Initial completion was procession completions.json file every time.  
Then one more type from all.json (from Node.js sources) was added `ContentFromSources`,
 that was precompiled into sorted TreeSet inside Model class.
As one more type from Orion IndexFiles was added `ContentFromOrionIndexFiles`, it is clear that all types should be precompiled,
 and Model should be passed as parameter.

## Eclipse API 

org.eclipse.jface.text.contentassist.IContentAssistProcessor


A content assist processor proposes completions and computes context information for a particular content type. A content assist processor is a org.eclipse.jface.text.contentassist.IContentAssistant plug-in. 

This interface must be implemented by clients. Implementers should be registered with a content assistant in order to get involved in the assisting process.
